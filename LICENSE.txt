 Use of the Data
 The user assumes the entire risk as to the accuracy and the use of this
 data. The data may be used, copied and distributed subject to the following
 conditions:
	1. INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS DOCUMENT IS PROVIDED "AS IS"
   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,

	2. The data may be included in any commercial package provided that any
   commerciality is based on value added by the provider and not on a value
   ascribed to the EPSG dataset which is made available at no charge. The
   ownership of the EPSG dataset [OGP] must be acknowledged.
	3. Subsets of information may be extracted from the dataset. Users are
   advised that coordinate reference system and coordinate transformation
   descriptions are incomplete unless all elements detailed as essential
   in OGP Surveying and Positioning Guidance Note 7-1 annex F are included.
	4. Essential elements should preferably be reproduced as described in the
   dataset.  Modification of parameter values is permitted as described in
   the table below to allow change to the content of the information provided
   that numeric equivalence is achieved.  Numeric equivalence refers to the
   results of geodetic calculations in which the parameters are used, for
   example (i) conversion of ellipsoid defining parameters, or (ii) conversion
   of parameters between one and two standard parallel projection methods,
   or (iii) conversion of parameters between 7-parameter geocentric
   transformation methods.
   (EPSG provides a table at this point with some details)
	5. No data that has been modified other than as permitted in these terms
   and conditions shall be described as or attributed to the EPSG dataset.

libjpeg-turbo
***********************************
 libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses:
	1.The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed below
	This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs
   (any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)
	2.The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below
	This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs.
	3.The zlib License, which is listed below
	This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo
   SIMD extensions.

	*1.The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License*
 The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
 with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
 fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
 its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

 This software is copyright (C) 1991-2016, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.
 All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
 Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
 software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
 conditions:
	(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
 README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
 unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
 must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
	(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
 documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
 the Independent JPEG Group".
	(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
 NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
 not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
 acknowledge us.
 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
 in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
 it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
 software".
 We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
 commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
 assumed by the product vendor.
 The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
 It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
 The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
 ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
 but is also freely distributable.
 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
 To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading
 support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
 to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW
 algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
 by all standard GIF decoders.
 We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of

PCRE
***********************************
 PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
 and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

 Release 10 of PCRE2 is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
 specified below. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc"
 directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data
 in the testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

 The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
 included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
 optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
 the library is built.

 PostGIS has dependencies on other libraries which are not under GPL and

 these are dynamically linked libraries.  Libraries are as follows:

 LibXML - http://xmlsoft.org/ -- X/MIT License
 GDAL - http://gdal.osgeo.org/ -- X/MIT Style License

 The following loader/dumper files are derivative works or direct ports
 of ShapeLib which is under an X/MIT License: loader/dbfopen,safileio.*,
 shapefil.h, shpopen.c
 These are under AT&T public domain (someone should probably verify)
 loader/getopt.*
 Doc/xsl files
 These are under a BSD Style license
***********************************

proj.4
***********************************
 All source, data files and other contents of the PROJ.4 package are
 available under the following terms.  Note that the PROJ 4.3 and earlier
 was "public domain" as is common with US government work, but apparently
 this is not a well defined legal term in many countries.  I am placing
 everything under the following MIT style license because I believe it is
 effectively the same as public domain, allowing anyone to use the code as
 they wish, including making proprietary derivatives.

 Though I have put my own name as copyright holder, I don't mean to imply
 I did the work.  Essentially all work was done by Gerald Evenden.

SQLite
***********************************
 All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

 The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.

 All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

 TinyXML-2 grew from that effort. Lee Thomason is the original author
